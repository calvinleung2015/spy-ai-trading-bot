Trend-Following Trap: In 2022, the SPY had clear, sustained directional moves. In 2023, the market shifted to a "mean-reverting" regime characterized by frequent "fake-outs."

Premature Signal Triggering: Because the ML_PROB_THRESHOLD was fixed, the bot entered trades on weak momentum signals that immediately reversed, hitting the stop-loss repeatedly.

Overfitting to Volatility: The 2022 success was driven by large price swings. When volatility compressed in early 2023, the fixed profit targets were too far away to be hit, while the stop-losses remained vulnerable.
